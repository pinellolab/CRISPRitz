# CRISPRitz 
[![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/crispritz/README.html)

CRISPRitz is a software package containing 5 different tools dedicated to perform predictive analysis and result assessement on CRISPR/Cas experiments.

![fig_pipeline_breve-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32717860/53018798-93e99700-3453-11e9-85a9-89eba18b18bb.png)

With this aim in mind we created this package, containing the following software tools:

- add-variants: Tool to encode genomic variants using the IUPAC code. The ouput is a set of files representing the genome enriched with variants in IUPAC notation form.
- index-genome: Tool to find the candidate targets in a genome starting from a PAM. The ouput is a set of files, containing all the sequences of candidate targets extracted from the genome.
- search: Tool to perform off-target search on a genome (with or without variants) or genome index (with or without variants). The ouput is a set of files, one is a list of all targets and off-targets found, the others are profile files containing detailed information for each guide , like bp/mismatches and on/off-targets count.
- annotate-results: Tool to annotate results found during search with functional annotations (promoter, chromatin accessibility, insulator, etc). The output is a set of files, one is the list of on/off-targets with the annotation type, the others are files containing counts for each guide, the counts are the total on/off-targets found with the specific mismatch threshold and the specific annotation.
- generate-report: Tool to generate a graphical report with annotated and overall mismatch and bulge profile for a given guide. The output is a graphical representation of the input guide behaviour.
